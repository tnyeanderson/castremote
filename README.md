# castremote

**Requires [pychromecast](https://github.com/balloob/pychromecast)**

This library uses [anygpio](https://github.com/tnyeanderson/anygpio), a cross-platform GPIO library for SBCs!

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

Provides controls for Chromecasts. Built to be run on a Pi Zero W in a battery powered enclosure. Provides functionality for volume control, mute, seeking by increments, stop casting, and play/pause. Uses GPIO pins to detect hardware buttons.


Circuit diagrams and build photos to come. See example script in `docs/example.py` to get started!
